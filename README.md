- Make a GET request to "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"

- Display all users as contacts and the associated properties (name, email, website) in a table

- A user should be able to add a new contact by filling out the form and clicking on the "Add" button

- If any of the fields are empty, users should not be able to add a new contact, and the application should alert with the message "Fields cannot be empty!"
